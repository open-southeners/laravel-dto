## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.2] - 2023-10-25

### Fixed

- laravel-helpers package version constraints so it doesn't conflict with any other package that uses it in the same way (or even the root project)

## [3.1.1] - 2023-10-23

### Fixed

- Serialisation using old `BindModelUsing` instead of new `BindModel` attribute

## [3.1.0] - 2023-10-23

### Added

- JSON strings to collections (arrays or Illuminate's Collection instances)

## [3.0.3] - 2023-10-17

### Fixed

- Regression introduced by morphs fix using abstract `Model` class

## [3.0.2] - 2023-10-17

### Fixed

- Morph binding using generic Illuminate's model class (not instantiable), fallbacks to `Relation::morphMap`

## [3.0.1] - 2023-10-17

### Fixed

- Passing through with no type casting already matching typed properties (enums, objects, etc...)

## [3.0.0] - 2023-10-16

### Added

- Morph support for data transfer objects model properties and collection properties. For e.g: `public Film|Post $taggable, public string $taggableType`
- Simplificated `OpenSoutheners\LaravelDto\Attributes\BindModel` attribute grouping all the model binding options.
- Support for `OpenSoutheners\LaravelDto\Attributes\BindModel` attribute in morph properties, which can be also used to customise the type key name. For e.g. from the same example from above:

```php
#[BindModel(
  using: [Post::class => 'slug'],
  with: [Post::class => 'tags', Film::class => ['tags', 'posts']],
  morphTypeKey: 'tagType'
)]
public Film|Post $taggable,
public string $tagType
```

### Changed

- **Replace all `#[BindModelUsing('attribute')]` to `#[BindModel(using: 'attribute')]` in your code (take in mind it must not be repeated under the same property)**
- **Replace all `#[BindModelWith(['relation1', 'relation2'])]` to `#[BindModel(with: ['relation1', 'relation2'])]` in your code (take in mind it must not be repeated under the same property)**

- Sending multiple values (for e.g. 1,2,5) on a collection with `BindModelUsing` attribute or custom model's `getRouteKeyName` method now works querying all models

## [1.10.10] - 2023-10-09

### Fixed

- Request option for `make:dto` command when sent without a value fails

## [1.10.7] - 2023-10-06

### Fixed

- `DataTransferObject::toArray` when DTO constructed `fromArray` is getting request stuff, it doesn't get all properties

## [1.10.6] - 2023-10-05

### Fixed

- `make:dto` with request option doesn‚Äôt add class string to static method

## [1.10.5] - 2023-10-05

- Validation not applied for ValidatedDataTransferObject interface DTOs

## [1.10.3] - 2023-10-04

### Changed

- `ValidatedDataTransferObject` interface is no longer resolved, instead `DataTransferObject` class will be the one resolved (for those DTOs that doesn't have a `FormRequest` class on them, validated form data)

## [1.10.2] - 2023-10-04

### Changed

- Better error reporting when DTO class is being bound to a controller

- Collections does not get mapped when Illuminate's collection has been sent to DTO

## [1.10.0] - 2023-09-27

### Changed

- Model binding defaults to primary key instead of `Model::getRouteKeyName()` (which should be used for those coming from routes instead)
- Route bound models are using specified attributes instead of default to IDs (model's primary keys). For e.g. `posts/{post:slug}` will use slug on the DTO query

### Fixed

### Fixed

- `DataTransferObject::toArray()` method now returns arrays with nested `toArray` calls when collections or models

## [1.8.0] - 2023-09-07

### Added

- `php artisan make:dto --request='App\Http\Requests\PostCreateFormRequest' PostCreateData` will now fill the request part and all properties for you with their types (**experimental**)
- Map arrays or json strings into generic objects (`\stdClass`) or custom objects (using their classes)
- Map string dates into `Illuminate\Support\Carbon` or `Carbon\Carbon` or `Carbon\CarbonImmutable` instances

## [1.7.1] - 2023-09-01

## [1.6.0] - 2023-08-31

- Add binding resolution so DataTransferObjects can act as validated requests using `ValidatedDataTransferObject` interface
- Add authenticated user ‚Äúautomagical‚Äù binding to `DataTransferObject` property when possible (need to be typed as Authenticatable illuminate's contract)

## [1.5.1] - 2023-08-10

### Fixed

- Minor issue, now doesn't query when sending model instance using `DataTransferObject::fromArray()` method

## [1.5.0] - 2023-05-02

### Changed

- Properties returned from `toArray` are now snake cased (from `myPropertyName` to `my_property_name`)

## [1.4.0] - 2023-04-26

### Added

- Introducing mapped types using docblock `@param` type like the following: `@param array<\App\Models\MyModel> $models` or `@param \Illuminate\Support\Collection<\App\Models\MyModel> $models`
- Optional normalisation option for properties names (`workspace_id` to `workspace`, `post_tags` to `postTags`, etc) to package config file (publish using command `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="OpenSoutheners\LaravelDto\ServiceProvider"`)
- Attribute `OpenSoutheners\LaravelDto\Attributes\NormaliseProperties` to use in some DTO classes that needs properties normalisation (when globally disabled from config)
- Attribute `OpenSoutheners\LaravelDto\Attributes\BindModelWith` to bind to model with relationships included
